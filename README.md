All code files for CSE 527 final project on ablation studies on normalized Vision Transformers. Most of the code is available in both python files and jupyter notebook format as the code was first written in a code editor and then transferred to be run on Google Colab and other similar platforms. Some code was run locally or on the AI cluster for which there are no corresponding jupyter notebooks.
